# Overview

In my attemt to become better at using the java programming language, I decided to build a finance tracker that runs on pc. 
The purpose of this application is to calculate the amount of profit you earn per hour of work, after calculating expenses, hours worked, salary, and taxes. 

My reason for learning the Java language has been to ease my way into phone application development. As such this is the first step in a learning journey I am taking.

# Development Environment

I developed this project using the Java language. I used scene builder to create the user interface.

# Future Work

I likely will not be working on this project in the future, that being said it could use some improvements.

- I could make the app change dynamically, so that the text becomes bigger when the window changes sizes, as well as other modifications.
- I could made different smaller applications within a larger application so that the finance tracker is more applicable. Another useful app would be to come up with how much a mortgage is going to cost you.
- I would love to find a way to format the data so that you can instantly make relevant pie charts within my excel documents.
